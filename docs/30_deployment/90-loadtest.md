# Loadtesting results

### These are the reference sizing and loadtesting results 
These test are done in AWS eks.

Note: 
- Pod CPU limit = 0.2 core
- Pod RAM limit = 128MB
- gp2 IOPS = 300
- RDS IOPS = 3000 (base) / 1061 IOPS (observed)

### detail report

#### Setup

- environment: aws
- Cluster type: EKS
- number of nodes: 4
- number of cores: 8
- Ram: 32gb
- number of cores per node: 2
- Ram per node: 8gb
- Machine type used: t3a.large
- Tool used: Artillery/Playwright

Figure 1 Artillery installed in EC2 instance in AWS testing the EKS cluster

In Figure 1, you can see the setup of the tester EC2 instance that was used to test the EKS clusters. Artillery and Playwright were installed in the EC2 instance so that they can run the test script, and they hit the AWS EKS clusters through the internet.

#### test steps

> - 1) User go to the log in page of AOH. 
> - 2) User enters username and password into the respective fields. 
> - 3) User waits for dashboard to load. 
> - 4) User go to Incident page. 
> - 5) User checks that the page is loaded (Add button). 
> - 6) User wait for 2 seconds (simulate think time).
> - 7) User go to Trips page.
> - 8) User waits for 2 seconds (simulates thini time).
> - 9) User goes back to incident page again.
> - 10) the loop goes on for 85 cycles.

From the test steps above, you can calculate that each user test run will take a minumum time of 340 seconds, assuming the system respond immediately.

Figure 2 http request distribution graph for test result 1

From Figure 2, you can observe that most of the http requests were made on the first 190 seconds of the test. This can be explained with the test steps involved.

Figure 3 peak request recorded over a 10 seconds period for test result 1

From figure 3, you can see that the peak http request is about 636, over a period of 10 seconds.

Figure 5 peak request recorded over a 10 seconds period for test result 2

From figure 5, you can see that the peak http request is about 2648, over a period of 10 seconds. 

Most of the load happens on the first 250 seconds.

Additional Notes:
- IO2 is very expensive (costs $0.072 USD per IOPS)

- However, Aurora seems very cost effective for our use case which have varied IOPS thru the day.
