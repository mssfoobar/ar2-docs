<!-- Chapter content here -->

### 
1) VM is cloned with Firefox, OBS, webcam simulator stream installed
2) Firefox, OBS, webcam simulator stream is installed
3) Webcam simulator is started, OBS is started
4) 1st User insteance is started up and logged in for Firefox, 1-1 video call is engaged with 2nd User

![Message Bus](./images/sfu_Receive.png)
Figure 1b graph of receiving network activity of SFU during the test

From figure 1a and 1b, you can observe that for 100 pairs of 1-1 calls, the network required is about 15.7MB/s

![Message Bus](./images/SFU_CPU.png)
Figure 2 CPU utilisation

From Figure 2, you can observe that the SFU is using about 1.8 CPU cores during the time where it is serving 100 pairs of 1-1 calls. Since each node has 4 cores, the utilisation rate is below 50%. 


![Message Bus](./images/sfu_CLusterCPUload_totalCluster.png)
Figure 3 total cluster load

From FIgure 3, you can observe that the total cluster load increased to 62.5% during the test. However, this is still under the 80% threshold, which is typically the benchmark used for load testing

Appendix A OBS as a virtual webcam

Apart from steaming a PC screen to major streaming sites,  OBS can emulate a webcam onto the client using the many source capture tools the OBS offers. For this test, the browser capture tool allows a user to load a webpage directly.

Appendix B why Spawn EC2 instance instead of spawing VMs on local servers
---
The bandwidth of the office to the wfm-qa environment is 99mbps. To prevent any bottle neck, it was decided to do future tests in the EC2 when possible.

2 Test steps
---
<!-- Chapter content here -->

### 
1) EC2 of type t3a.xlarge is spawned
2) Firefox, OBS, webcam simulator stream is installed
3) Webcam simulator is started, OBS is started
3) 1st User insteance is started up and logged in for Firefox, 1-1 video call is engaged with 2nd User
4) 2nd User instance is started up and logged in in Firefox private mode. 1-1 vidoe call is engaged with 4th User
5) Another EC2 is spawned.
6) Firefox, OBS, webcam simulator stream is installed 
7) Webcam simulator is started, OBS is started
8) 3rd User insteance is started up and logged in for Firefox, 1-1 video call is engaged with 1st User
9) 4th User instance is started up and logged in in Firefox private mode. 1-1 vidoe call is engaged with 2nd User
10) The process is repeated until the targetted number of users are spawned.


 However, due to  time and money constrain, the test was stopped on the forth day.

Figure 1b graph of EC2 with 

From figure 1b,around 1835hrs on 23rd April, you can observe that most EC2s will converge to about 1.1MBps - 1.58MBps when two streams are up, and around 550kBps in Figure 1a when one steam upload is happening.
The total streams translate to 84 streams, with 27 EC2 with 2 streams, and 30 streams with 1 stream.

Figure 2b graph of EC2 with at least one streams input running

From Figure 2, around 1730hrs on 23rd April, you can observe that more tha 27 EC2s have bandwidth ingesion running at around 1.1MBps, which indicates that there are two streams running and 30 EC2s running from 200 - 600kBps, which indicates that it is running at least 1 stream. At this point of time there are at least 84 streams being ingested at the same time.

From figure 3b and 3c, you can observe two different clients displaying the last frame of the video call that they received. 
 
#### 3) It seems that the SFU  converges to CPU 34%

Figure 4 CPU comsumption of SFU over time

From Figure 4, you can observe the CPU usage of the SFU over the testing period. 
-- the Highest usage recorded is about 50%, which translate to a consumption of 1 core, and about 80 streams
-- As streams starts to drop, the CPU consumption will converge to the 34%. (log shaped graph)

### Apendix C CPU comparison of aws t3a mahcines and local dev environmnet
With data extracted from cpubenchmark (https://www.cpubenchmark.net/compare/3561vs3555/Intel-Xeon-Platinum-8260-vs-AMD-EPYC-7702P), the t3a CPU(AMD EPYC 7702P) used in the AWS cluster is about 2x more powerful than the intel processor(Intel Xeon Platinum 8260) use in the dev environment, even though that the single core performance for the intel is higher than the AMD processor.
