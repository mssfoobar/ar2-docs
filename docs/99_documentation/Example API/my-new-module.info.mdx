This is an example API documentation for you to use as reference. This introduction is generated from the
Open API description: `{ info: { description: "..." } }`. 

Please provide enough information here for users to
understand what this API is for. It is OK for this description to have some overlap with the root introduction
as the Open API file should be portable and should be applicable in other Open API tools as well.

This example contains 3 `info` endpoints which should be standard across all services:
- Liveliness
- Readiness
- Version

Read their descriptions to find out what these endpoints are about.

The other examples are with just a generic 'entity' with the `id` and `message` properties.
