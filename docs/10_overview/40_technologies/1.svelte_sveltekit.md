# Svelte & SvelteKit

We've chosen `Svelte` as our primary component-based UI framework and `SvelteKit` as the web application framework
(routing) for `Svelte`.

## What is Svelte?
`Svelte` is a JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. It is component-based, much like the ever-popular `React`.
However, unlike `React`, it does not create a virtual DOM and diff changes against it. `Svelte` shifts that work into the
_compile_ step instead. `Svelte's` compiler can determine all the places where your code changes state -
[it does so by checking variable assignments](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/reactive-assignments).

### Why we've chosen Svelte

The knee-jerk reaction you might have is why use `Svelte` when we already have `React`, a mature, popular framework
with the backing of Facebook/Meta.

`Svelte` is **easier** to pick up than `React` and is simply easy to learn in absolute terms. It's also feature-rich and
highly **performant** - because it does not use a virtual DOM, `Svelte` is _fast_.

Our choice to go with `Svelte` is also to get ahead of the curve. Trends are showing that `Svelte` is well-loved by
the developer community and is constantly growing in popularity. `Svelte` was voted the 
[most loved web framework](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021#section-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-web-frameworks)
in the Stack Overflows' 2021 survey won the [highest satisfaction ratings](https://2020.stateofjs.com/en-US/technologies/front-end-frameworks/)
in State of JS's 2020 survey.

With **Rich Harris'** induction into **Vercel** at the end of 2021, `Svelte` also now has the backing of a strong web-oriented tech-company
and we believe it is a safe and forward-looking choice to use as our predominant framework.

## What is SvelteKit?

`SvelteKit` is an application framework for building extremely high-performance web apps.

Building an app with all the modern best practices is complicated. Those practices include build
optimizations, so that you load only the minimal required code; offline support; prefetching pages before the user
initiates navigation; and configurable rendering that allows you to generate HTML on the server or in the browser at
runtime or at build-time. `SvelteKit` does all that for us.

It uses `Vite` with a `Svelte` plugin to provide a lightning-fast and feature-rich development experience with
Hot Module Replacement (HMR), where changes to your code are reflected in the browser instantly.

### Why we've chosen SvelteKit

`SvelteKit` is the easiest way to get started with `Svelte`. It's the official web application framework for `Svelte`
and is being developed closely in tandem with `Svelte`. Apart from that, it also has many best practices and
optimizations built-in whilst providing a great developer experience with `Vite's` speedy _Hot Module Replacement_.
