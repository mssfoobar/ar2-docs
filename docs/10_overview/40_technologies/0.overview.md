# Technology Overview

To support the infrastructure to allow our systems to be distributed, scalable, durable, performant,
maintainable, and to allow automated testing, security scanning and alerting, and deployment, many different pieces
need to fit together to support the backbone of the system.

The following is an evolving list of technologies chosen to support development of the `AOH` platform.

# Platform Infrastructure

:::info

Items in the list that do not have a tick [✓] are prospective candidates that are being evaluated.

:::

### Container Management

-   [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) [✓]

    In order to support a micro-services architecture, we need to be able to orchestrate the automatic scaling or services.
    Our services need to be containerized and monitored, stood up or down depending on their needs, and have their traffic
    routed accordingly. The de-facto standard across the industry for container orchestration is Kubernetes, which is what
    we've adopted.

-   [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) [✓]

    Container engine.

### Ingress Controller

    We use Traefik as a reverse proxy and load balancer to manage access to cluster services in Kubernetes. It is open
    source, well-documented, and is actively maintained and developed by a large community of users and contributors.

-   ~~[NGINX](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-ingress-controller/)~~

### Service Mesh

-   [Gloo Mesh](https://www.solo.io/products/gloo-mesh/)

    We plan to use Gloo Mesh for service discovery and observability - this will be required to manage the communication
    between many services in a structured, reliable way.
