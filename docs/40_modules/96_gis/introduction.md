# GIS - Geospatial Information Services

The GIS module provides essential features for command and control systems to display information in a geospatial
context - specifically, on a map.

Features:

- Map rendering interface (CesiumJS implementation)
    - Using renderes other than CesiumJS is possible but requires interface implementation
- Camera Bookmarks
    - Save and delete camera position
    - Fly to saved camera position
- Geospatial Entity Rendering
    - Render entities on the map based on their position
    - Render entities conditionally and change their styles based on entity attributes
