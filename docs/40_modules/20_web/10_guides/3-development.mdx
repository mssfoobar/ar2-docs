# Development

The scope of this document is not to be a tutorial on [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/basics) and
[Svelte Kit](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/introduction), you should visit their official documentation to learn more
about them. This is meant to be a quick reference to help you can create components using our stack; how our folders are
structured, how `state` is managed, how we approach unit and end-to-end testing, etc.

## Creating A Simple Svelte Component

Our components rest inside the `src/lib/components` folder. Each component rests in a separate folder with the following
files:

-   `index.svelte`: The Svelte file for the component
-   `index.d.ts`: Ambient declaration file to support the component
-   `test.svelte`: An instantiation of the component, used to test the component, as well as provide examples on how to
    use it
-   `comp.test.ts`: The _Playwright_ test for the component - the project is configured to visit and perform actions on
    the _test.svelte_ file via the `/tests` route.

### [index.svelte](https://svelte.dev/repl/286607b464814418b643d47400463644?version=3.49.0)

View the code on [Svelte REPL](https://svelte.dev/repl/286607b464814418b643d47400463644?version=3.49.0)

The following is a simple Svelte component demonstrating data binding, reactivity, and iteratively rendering based on
data.

```tsx title="index.svelte"
<script>
	let exampleObjects = [];
	let currentText = "Hello new developer!";

	let totalCount = 1;

	function addObject() {
		exampleObjects.push({text: currentText, count: totalCount});
		exampleObjects = exampleObjects; // reactivity is based on assignments, assign it to itself to force reactivity
		totalCount++;
	}
</script>

<input type="text" bind:value={currentText}>
<button on:click={addObject}>
	ADD OBJECT
</button>
<div>
	{#each exampleObjects as xo }
		<div>
			{xo.count}. {xo.text}
		</div>
	{/each}
</div>
```

Though `JavaScript` is loved for it's speed of development and flexibility, the great freedom provided by it also makes
maintaining large projects a nightmare. `TypeScript` is a must - it allows yourself and other developers to understand
the shape of the objects being passed around. To have your types available throughout the project, we use an ambient
typescript declaration file:

### index.d.ts

Here's an example declaration for the component we wrote:

```ts title="index.d.ts"
declare interface ExampleObject {
    text: string;
    count: number;
}
```

And here is the TypeScript version of that componet (the `index.svelte`) shown earlier.

```tsx title="index.svelte"
<script lang="ts">
	let exampleObjects: Array<ExampleObject> = [];
	let currentText = "Hello new developer!";

	let totalCount = 1;

	function addObject() {
		exampleObjects.push({text: currentText, count: totalCount});
		exampleObjects = exampleObjects;
		totalCount++;
	}
</script>

<input type="text" bind:value={currentText}>
<button on:click={addObject}>
	ADD OBJECT
</button>
<div>
	{#each exampleObjects as xo }
		<div>
			{xo.count}. {xo.text}
		</div>
	{/each}
</div>
```

With the ambient declaration file, we can use the `ExampleObject` throughout our project, enabling great features like
type checking and IntelliSense.

### [test.svelte](https://svelte.dev/repl/54ac8421e91e4506aa515ce92290fb9e?version=3.49.0)

Every component should have examples on how to use them, and tests to ensure they are running correct. We provide these
by having a `test.svelte` file next to our `index.svelte` file.

Example usage of `index.svelte`:

```tsx title="test.svelte"
<script>
	import DeveloperGreeter from './index.svelte';
</script>

<div>
	<h1>
		Look at this thing I made:
	</h1>
	<DeveloperGreeter />
</div>
```

### comp.test.ts

For unit-testing components, we have the component folder structure mirrored in the `/tests` route, and we dynamically
render the components based on the route. We then have `Playwright` visit the component pages to perform tests on them.

Here is a sample of what the `comp.test.ts` file might look like for the component we wrote above:

```tsx title="comp.test.ts"
import { test } from "@playwright/test";

test("click buttons", async ({ page }) => {
    // Go to http://localhost:4173/tests/components/basic/Button
    await page.goto("http://localhost:4173/tests/components/DeveloperGreeter");
    await page.locator("text='ADD OBJECT'").click();
    await page.locator("text='1. Hello new developer!'").toBeVisible();
});
```

In the future, we might switch to Playwright's [`components`](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-components) feature.
However, it is still currently experiemental.

## Styling and Theming

[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) is a responsive, highly extensible, utility-first CSS framework. It has a
design system built-in, like Bootstrap, but unlike Bootstrap, it is much more flexible and meant to be used a little
bit like in-lining your CSS. Read their [core concepts](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/utility-first) to learn more
about the rationale behind Tailwind.

For theming, we use [Tailwind's theme configuration system](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/theme) to create our own
themes. In the `tailwind.config.cjs` file, you can see how we have it extended.

The colors are named and assigned to a list of CSS variables that are assigned to the root element (`html`) - you can
see this in the `app.html` file:

```html title="app.html"
<html lang="en" class="theme-1 bg-background"></html>
```

The default theme is called `theme-1` and `bg-background` is the background color (specified with `bg-`) using the
`background` key that we've assigned in the `tailwind.config.cjs` file. That `background` is given the CSS variable
`--background-color: 255 255 255`, which is defined in `themes.css`.

```css title="themes.css"
--background-color: 255 255 255;
```

Changing this variable changes the color for anything using `background` and that is how we change themes on the fly.

To define more themes, simply add more classes to the `themes.css` file and change the class on the `html` element.

Example:

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="theme" label="themes.css" default>

```css title="themes.css"
... {
    /* other themes... */
}

.theme-2 {
    /* Primary */
    --primary-color: 62 78 111;
    --on-primary-color: 222 222 222;
    --primary-light-color: 124 124 255;
    --primary-dark-color: 12 13 80;

    /* Secondary */
    --secondary-color: 152 170 32;
    --on-secondary-color: 12 12 12;

    /* and so on... */
}

... {
    /* other themes... */
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="html" label="app.html">

```html title="app.html"
<html lang="en" class="theme-2 bg-background"></html>
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Pulling data with GraphQL

Our framework uses [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) to pull data from the server, and `GraphQL Subscriptions` to receive
updates.

### Making a GraphQL query

In your `index.svelte` or more likely, your `+page.ts` or `+page.server.ts` file (please read up on
[routing in Svelte Kit](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/routing#page-page-server-js)), you can make a GraphQL query using
the `gql` tag. The `graphql-tag` package provides this ability to convert the JavaScript template literal into a GraphQL
AST, which is then used by `graphql-codegen` to generate types for us to safely use.

Example usage:

```tsx
gql`
    query WidgetConfig {
        configuration_widget {
            config
            name
            type
            uuid
        }
    }
`;
```

We store our GraphQL client (urql) in a Svelte Store, which you can get, and use to make queries via urql's API.

:::warning

To effectly understand the next section, you need a basic understanding of:

-   [Svelte & Svelte Kit](/docs/docs/overview/technologies/svelte_sveltekit)
-   [Graph QL](/docs/docs/overview/technologies/svelte_sveltekit)
-   [urql](/docs/docs/overview/technologies/svelte_sveltekit)

:::

Here is an example Svelte [_page_](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/routing#page-page-js) with a `Svelte Kit`
load function that makes a GraphQL query and passes the result as props to the page component:

The `WidgetConfigQuery` type and `WidgetConfigDocument` exports are generated using `graphql-codegen`, which will be
elaborated on in the next section.

```ts title="+page.ts"
import { gqlClient } from "$lib/stores/Clients";
import { get } from "svelte/store";
import {
    type WidgetConfigQuery,
    WidgetConfigDocument,
} from "./index.generated";

gql`
    query WidgetConfig {
        configuration_widget {
            config
            name
            type
            uuid
        }
    }
`;

export async function load({}) {
    const client = get(gqlClient);
    const response = await client
        .query<WidgetConfigQuery>(WidgetConfigDocument)
        .toPromise();

    return {
        props: {
            configuration_widget: response.data?.configuration_widget,
        },
    };
}
```

```tsx title="+page.svelte"
<script lang="ts">... export let configuration_widget = {}; ...</script>
```

### Making a GraphQL Subscriptions

Urql performs GraphQL subscriptions using [Wonka](https://github.com/0no-co/wonka#wonka), a stream library. To handle
data received from Urql subscriptions, they must be piped into a `Wonka Subscribe` function and handled with a callback
function.

The following is a simple example of setting up a subscription using our framework. See the comments for more details.

```tsx title="+page.svelte"
<script lang="ts">
    import { SystemTimeDocument, type SystemTimeSubscription } from '$generated-types';

    import { get } from 'svelte/store';
    import { type Subscription, pipe as wPipe, subscribe as wSubscribe } from 'wonka';

    import { gqlClientStore } from '$lib/stores/Clients';
    import gql from 'graphql-tag';
    import { onDestroy, onMount } from 'svelte';

    let dateTime: ISO8601Date;
    let subscription: Subscription;

    onMount(async () => {
        // highlight-start
        // Get the GraphQL Client from the client store.
        // highlight-end
        const client = get(gqlClientStore);

        // highlight-start
        // Define the GraphQL subscription - this can be done in the same file, in a separate `.graphql` file, or
        // anywhere else - as long as it exists, graphql-codegen will pick it up and generate the subscription type and
        // object for use. Remember to run GraphQL Codegen!
        // highlight-end
        gql`
            subscription SystemTime {
                system_time {
                    reported_at
                }
            }
        `;

        // highlight-start
        // Store the subscription so we can call unsubscribe later.
        // highlight-end
        subscription = wPipe(
            client.subscription<SystemTimeSubscription>(SystemTimeDocument, {}),
            wSubscribe(result => {
                if (result?.data && result?.data?.system_time[0]) {
                    dateTime = result.data.system_time[0].reported_at;
                    console.log("Lets see the time!", dateTime);
                }
            })
        );
    });

    onDestroy(async () => {

        // highlight-start
        // Ensure you unsubscribe at the appropriate time. For example, when the component unmounts.
        // If you skip this step, your subscription will persist as your change pages (with client-side navigation)
        // highlight-end
        if (subscription) subscription.unsubscribe();
    });
</script>
```

### Query Types & GraphQL Codegen

We use `graphql-codegen` to generate the query shape/types from the the `schema.graphql` file. You can get the schema
file by using the introspection API from the GraphQL endpoint you are calling.

In `aoh-web`, we have an npm script called `getschema` which runs `gq` to get the `schema.graphql` file and places It
in the root directory. Learn how to use `gq` to pull the schema here:
https://hasura.io/docs/latest/guides/export-graphql-schema/

```bash
npm run getschema
```

We then have another npm script called `generate` which runs graphql-codegen. It reads the `codegen.yml` configuration
file to determine how where to get `schema.graphql` (we place it in the root folder), along with all other files that
store your queries and uses these files to generate the types. They appear in a folder called `generated`
which is excluded from .git.

```bash
npm run generate
```

After generating these types, you can now have full typescript definitions for your GraphQL queries. Remember to run
`npm run getschema` again whenever your GraphQL schema changes, and to run `npm run generate` whenever you write new
queries, or need to update the queries with the new schema.

## Handling Authentication

### JWT Access Token

Authentication of requests is done via the `jwt`. The `urql` client has been set up to use the JWT acquired from logging
in to the system. It also automatically handles token refreshes and query retries. On the server-side client, the token
is attached to the request header as a Bearer Authorization token. On the client side, it is sent to `Hasura`
automatically via cookies. This usage of cookies on the client-side is an additional security measure to avoid exposing
the token to access via JavaScript. This means you will not able to access the access token on the client/browser in
JavaScript.

To accomodate this, we have multiple instances of Hasura set up, each set to handle different modes of authentication.

### Broken Queries, Subscriptions, and Retries

There are 2 layers of retries that have been set up:

-   The `urql` client has been set up to handle retries via the `retryExchange`.
-   The `graphql-ws` client has been set up to handle broken WebSocket connections with retries
-   They are both configured to exponentially backoff retries on failure.

The `urql` client is set up to retry only subscriptions, as it is assumed that when you make a subscription, you want
this connection to be open and receiving data indefinitely. Queries are not retried, but you may configure this
behaviour by modifying `Clients.ts` in `src/lib/stores/Clients.ts`.

Subscriptions use the `graphql-ws` transport, this creates and manages a websocket connection, which `urql` then uses.
The JWT is passed to Hasura when the subscription is first created and the websocket connection gets opened. Hasura then
uses the expiry time in the token to decide when to terminate the GraphQL connection. This closing of the connection
causes all subscriptions to fail - then will then all be automatically retried with the new access token.

In some cases, you might have passed a variable into your subscription that might need to be updated when a retry
occurs. This is particularly necessary when you use Hasura's streaming subscriptions, which requires a cursor to
determine where to start pulling data from. Your subscription would be retried with the original cursor value, causing
your application to retrieve duplicate data. To deal with this, you must pass a context object with the properties
`onConnectionClosed` and `onConnectionConnected` to your GraphQL subscriptions. These must contain a callback
function that takes in an operation as an argument and returns nothing. An event listener will call these functions when
the GraphQL WebSocket connection closes and connects respectively, allowing you to reset subscriptions as needed.

Example:

```tsx title="Streaming Subscriptions with Timestamp Cursor Example" {23-42}
onMount(async () => {
    const client = get(gqlClientStore);

    gql`
        subscription ExampleStreaming($createdAt: timestampz) {
            some_data_stream {
                id
            }
        }
    `;

    let streamingSubscription: Subscription;

    function createExampleStreamingSubscription() {
        return wPipe(
            client.subscription<ExampleStreamingSubscription>(
                ExampleStreamingDocument,
                {
                    created_at:
                        dayjs($systemTime).toISOString() ??
                        dayjs().toISOString(),
                },
                {
                    // Pass in the callback function to update the operation variables on connection loss.
                    onConnectionClosed: (operation: Operation) => {
                        operation.variables = {
                            created_at:
                                dayjs($systemTime).toISOString() ??
                                dayjs().toISOString(),
                        };

                        // cleanup
                        streamingSubscription.unsubscribe();
                    },
                    onConnectionConnected: (operation: Operation) => {
                        // Only create subscriptions if they don't exist (or will be double-added in this callback)
                        if (!streamingSubscription) {
                            streamingSubscription =
                                createExampleStreamingSubscription();
                        }
                    },
                }
            ),
            wSubscribe((result) => {
                if (result?.data && result?.data?.some_data_stream[0]) {
                    logger.debug(
                        { id: result.data.some_data_stream[0].id },
                        "How? Is this what you want?"
                    );
                }
            })
        );
    }

    streamingSubscription = createExampleStreamingSubscription();
});
```

## Managing State

A key point to take note about using Svelte Stores with Svlete Kit is that whenever stores are run on the server, it is
global - meaning when running hybrid rendering or server-side rendering (any code in `.svelte` that has no
`if (browser)` checks or isn't run inside `onMount()`). This means you should always set stores in a browser context
only.

Reference issue: https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/discussions/4339

## FontAwesome

We are using the SVG+JS for extra features. combining this with SVG Sprites can allow us to save a lot of space. However,
for maintainbility reasons, we are currently using the full set of icons (15MB).

https://fontawesome.com/v6/docs/apis/javascript/tree-shaking

Using tree-shaking, we can get rid of all the unused icons - this configuration will be handled in the future.

https://fontawesome.com/docs/web/dig-deeper/webfont-vs-svg#side-by-side-comparison

If many instances of the same icon is needed - use SVG Sprites for better performance.
If many different icons are needed - load everything and use the Web Fonts + CSS method.

The SVG + JS method of using Font Awesome is all contained in a js file (all.js). This can be massively optimized by
choosing only the styles that you need. [FontAwesome SVG+JS](https://fontawesome.com/docs/web/setup/host-yourself/svg-js)

## Testing

Successful development involves testing. It is a big topic on its own, so please visit the respective pages to
learn how we handle testing.

-   [Test Driven Development Testing (TDD)](testing/TDD-Testing.md)
-   [Behaviour Driven Development Testing (BDD)](testing/BDD-Testing.md)

We are expected to write out own unit tests and participate in integration tests.

## Creating Endpoints

All API endpoints created by the web server should be done at the `src/routes/api` folder. This is done by Creating
`+server.ts` files in the respective folder. For example, for the api to get the system time, the `+server.ts` file is
in `src/routes/api/info/time/+server.ts`.

See https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/routing#server for more information;

### Standard endpoint message format

As a standard for our system, we are adopting the following structure for the response payload for endpoints. This type
is defined in the `app.d.ts` as `HTTPResponseBody` and should be used to type all your API responses.

See: [Standard Response Format](/docs/20_development/60_guidelines/30_development.mdx#response-format)
