# Introduction

## Extending the Web-Base Module Ecosystem

The web-base provides a range of optional library packages, known as web-base modules, that can be installed to enhance its functionality and offer greater flexibility when building your web application. These modules can be as simple as a single page or JavaScript file, or a combination of both. This section will walk you through the process of creating and deploying these library packages, allowing you to customize and extend the web-base to meet your specific needs as well as sharing these extensions with other developers.

## Pre-requisite

### Web-base

When developing custom web-base modules, it's recommended to create them on top of a web-base template. This ensures that your modules are compatible with the web-base and can seamlessly integrate with its features. By building on a web-base template, you can:

- Ensure compatibility with the web-base core
- Leverage existing web-base functionality
- Streamline the development process

Start by creating a new project using a web-base template, and then build your custom module on top of it. This approach will save you time and effort in the long run, and guarantee a smooth integration with the web-base.
