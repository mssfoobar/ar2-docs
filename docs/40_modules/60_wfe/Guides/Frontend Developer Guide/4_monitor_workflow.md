# Monitor Workflow

When the workflow is running, it will generate events in the database. These events can be used to monitor the 
state of the workflow.

## Workflow Events

Belows are the events that will be generated by the workflow with their description.

<table>

<tr><td>WorkflowExecutionStarted</td><td>always the first event in a workflow execution event history</td></tr>
<tr><td>WorkflowExecutionCompleted</td><td>indicates that the workflow execution has successfully completed</td></tr>

<tr><td>WorkflowExecutionTimedOut</td><td>indicates that the workflow execution has timed out due to the workflow having not been completed within the given timeout duration</td></tr>

## Tracking Workflow Execution History

To track the workflow execution history, you can use the 
[Get Workflow Execution History API](../../Workflow%20API/10-get-workflow-execution-state-history.api.mdx) which returns 
the history of the workflow execution states up to the current state.
