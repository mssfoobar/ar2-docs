# Overview

The GraphQL Client is a utility that handles GraphQL queries and subscriptions, providing a programmatic interface for executing queries and subscriptions against a GraphQL server.
It is designed to simplify the process of working with GraphQL APIs, allowing developers to focus on building their application logic rather than implementing low-level GraphQL details.
