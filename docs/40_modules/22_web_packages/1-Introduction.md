## What are Packages?

Packages are optional add-ons that can enhance the functionality of your web-app. They can be easily integrated into:

A vanilla web-base, adding new features and capabilities
Your existing modules, extending their functionality and versatility
Think of packages as modular building blocks that allow you to customize and expand your web-app to meet your specific needs.
