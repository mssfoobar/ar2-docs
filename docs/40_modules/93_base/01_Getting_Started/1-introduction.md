# Introduction

The Web-base template is a frontend foundation built using Svelte, designed to accelerate the development of any frontend module. This template provides a solid starting point for building robust and scalable web applications.

## Key Features

- Public/Private Route Separation: The template includes a built-in routing system that separates protected and public routes, ensuring that sensitive areas of the application are only accessible to authenticated users while providing that control to the user.
- Keycloak Authentication: Web-base integrates with Keycloak, a popular open-source identity and access management solution, to provide secure authentication and authorization as well as multitenancy.
- Basic UI Components: The template includes a set of basic UI components, such as navigation, buttons, and forms, to help you get started with building your frontend module.

## Technologies used

In order to build off the web-base, there are a few prerequisite technologies that you'll have to pick up. We have chosen `Svelte` as our primary component-based UI framework and `Sveltekit` as the web application framework (routing) for Svelte.

We are also using `TypeScript`, on top of `JavaScript`, for better maintainability and improved developer productivity. `TypeScript` introduces static typing to `JavaScript`, which allows us to catch type-related errors at compile time rather than runtime.

For styling, we are using `TailwindCSS` to style our components.

For more information on these technologies, and why we've picked them, you can visit the [technologies section](../../../category/-technologies) to find out more.
