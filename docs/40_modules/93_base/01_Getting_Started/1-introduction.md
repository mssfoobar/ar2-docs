# Introduction

The Web-base template is a frontend foundation built using Svelte, designed to accelerate the development of any frontend module. This template provides a solid starting point for building robust and scalable web applications.

## Key Features

- Public/Private Route Separation: The template includes a built-in routing system that separates protected and public routes, ensuring that sensitive areas of the application are only accessible to authenticated users while providing that control to the user.
- Keycloak Authentication: Web-base integrates with Keycloak, a popular open-source identity and access management solution, to provide secure authentication and authorization as well as multitenancy.
- Basic UI Components: The template includes a set of basic UI components, such as navigation, buttons, and forms, to help you get started with building your frontend module.
