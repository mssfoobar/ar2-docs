# Overview

The web base is currently using Iconify as its icon library.
Iconify is a versatile icon library that provides multiple ways to load icons. To summarize, you can load icons from:

- Local Server: Host your own icon server and load icons from there.
- Iconify's Icon Server: Use Iconify's own server to load icons, eliminating the need for self-hosting.
- Direct Import: Import icon sets directly, which can be useful for offline or specific use cases,

## Tailwind plugin with Iconify

Our web application has been configured to utilize Tailwind classes for the incorporation of icons, thereby enhancing flexibility and customization capabilities. This implementation enables the utilization of utility classes to render icons, allowing for effortless modification of their appearance and behavior throughout the application.
