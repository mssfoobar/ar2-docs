# Introduction

The Incident Management Service provides a structured framework for the identification, prioritization, diagnosis, resolution, and documentation of generic incidents.

## Key Personas

This system is designed to be used by several key personas, each with distinct responsibilities.

1. Configurator: Responsible for defining and managing <a href='Incident/Custom Attributes/attribute'>custom attributes</a> within the system.
2. Incident Owner: Assigned to investigate and resolve incidents, responsible for assigning values to relevant attributes.
3. Incident Reporter: Individuals who initially report incidents within the system.
