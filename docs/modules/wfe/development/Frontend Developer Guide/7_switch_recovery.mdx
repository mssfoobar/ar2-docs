# Switch Recovery

When none of the conditions defined in the switch state are fulfilled, the workflow will throw an exception to allow 
manual recovery by the user.

The following example workflow will create switch recovery events because it is trying to evaluate the conditions 
whether 5 is equal to 1 or 2 and thus throws an exception.

### RecoverTaskScheduled

When this event is created, it generates `attributes.input` field with list of nearest activities that workflow can 
recovery from
```json
{
    "event_type": "RecoverTaskScheduled",
    "task_name": "Switch",
    "task_type": "Recover",
    "attributes": {
        "input": [["activity1", "activity2"], "Switch"]
    }
}
```
First object inside the `input` field is the list of activities. (as per above example: ["activity1", "activity2"])

### RecoverTaskStarted

When this event is created, it generates `attributes` field with

```json
{
    "event_type": "RecoverTaskStarted",
    "task_name": "Switch",
    "task_type": "Recover",
    "attributes": {
        "workflow_id": "0ee7f976-d85d-4856-8e5c-b5b635baca7a_29", 
        "workflow_run_id": "f6704d77-ad60-47ee-a328-48f7748d41c7"
    }
}
```

:::caution
Do not confuse `workflow_id` created by form activity with `workflow_id` from
[Start Workflow](3_workflow_execution.mdx#start-workflow). Former is the child `workflow_id` and latter is the parent
`workflow_id`. When you interact with form activity, you should use the child `workflow_id`.
:::

Workflow waits for the user input by creating listener with `acivity_name` value. To recover the workflow call the 
[Signal Workflow API](5_signal_workflow.mdx#signal-workflow-api) with `workflow_id`, `activity_name` and
request body. Request body data field must have the name of the activity to recover.

Based on the above example workflow, if we want to recover the workflow to `activity1`, frontend code will look like this

```javascript
const axios = require('axios');
let data = JSON.stringify({
    "data": "activity1"
});

let config = {
    method: 'post',
    maxBodyLength: Infinity,
    url: 'http://wfm.dev.ar2/v1/signal/workflow/:workflowid/signalname/:signalname',
    headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        'Accept': 'application/json'
    },
    data : data
};

axios(config)
    .then((response) => {
        console.log(JSON.stringify(response.data));
    })
    .catch((error) => {
        console.log(error);
    });
```

### FormTaskCompleted

When the workflow is finally recovered, this event will be created with recovered activity name inside the 
`attributes.result` field.
```json
{
    "event_type": "RecoverTaskCompleted",
    "task_name": "example",
    "task_type": "Recover",
    "attributes": {
        "result": ["Activity1"]
    }
}
```
