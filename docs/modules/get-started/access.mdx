# Access Configuration

As mentioned in previous section, release artifacts are available privately via
[GitHub Packages](https://docs.github.com/en/packages), and through
[GitHub Source Code Repositories](https://github.com/github).

If you are the project member that has been designated to move the release artifacts to your own artifact registry
and source code repository, you will need to have a `GitHub account` and have been granted access to AGIL Ops Hub's
private [packages](https://github.com/orgs/mssfoobar/packages) and [code repositories](https://github.com/mssfoobar/).

:::note
You may refer to
[these instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/creating-an-account-on-github) for
detailed steps on creating an account on GitHub.
:::

Once, you have a `GitHub account`, approach any AGIL Ops Hub member with your account details (`email address` /
`username`) to be granted access. You will then be able to download source code directly from
https://github.com/mssfoobar via your browser.

import downloadAsZipImg from "@site/static//img/modules/get-started/access/download-as-zip.png";

<div class="centerize">
	<div style={{ marginBottom: "2rem", maxWidth: "700px" }}>
		<Image img={downloadAsZipImg} />
	</div>
</div>

For `Container Images` and `Node Packages`, you will need to configure your `Docker` and `npm` as follows to access.

## Configuring `Docker` to have access to pull Container Images

1. To check if you have access to the container registry, you can login to your `GitHub account` and then browse for the required images here: https://github.com/orgs/mssfoobar/packages.
   If you are unable to see the container image you need, your account may not have the required access. Please approach AGIL Ops Hub team for assistant.

2. Next, you will need to generate a personal access token with `read:packages` scope to download container images. You can refer to GitHub's
   official instructions on how to generate personal access tokens here:
   [Creating a GitHub Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic)

3. Login to Docker with the token:

<CodeBlock language="bash">
	{`$ echo `}
	<span className="highlight">TOKEN</span>
	{` | docker login ghcr.io -u `}
	<span className="highlight">USERNAME</span>
	{` --password-stdin`}
</CodeBlock>

-   Replace <span className="highlight">TOKEN</span> with your token generated in step 2
-   Replace <span className="highlight">USERNAME</span> with your GitHub username

For more details on working with GitHub's container registry, you can refer to their
[official documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry).

## Configuring `npm` to have access to pull packages

The simplest way to pull released node packages is to use the `Web Base` and `Web CLI Tools` to pull the packages required.
By default, `Web Base` will include an `.npmrc` file which points to `npm.pkg.github.com` for npm packages with
the `@mssfoobar` scope.

Run the following command to configure `npm` to have access to pull the packages.

<CodeBlock language="bash">
	{`$ npm set //npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=`}
	<span className="highlight">GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN</span>
</CodeBlock>

-   Replace <span className="highlight">GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN</span>
