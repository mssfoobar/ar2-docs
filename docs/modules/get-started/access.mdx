# Access Configuration

As mentioned in previous section, release artifacts will be make available via private `GitHub Package Registry` and `Source Repository`.

If you are the designated project member to move the release artifacts to project own Artifact Registry and Source Repository, 
you will need to have a `GitHub account` and been granted access to AGIL Ops Hub private `GitHub Package Registry` and `Source Repository`.

If you don't already have, you need to create a personal `GitHub account`. Refer to 
[Creating an account on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/creating-an-account-on-github) for more information. 

Once, you have the `GitHub account`, approach any AGIL Ops Hub member to grant your account with the access.

With the appropriate access given, you will be able to access the private source repositories in https://github.com/mssfoobar. For `Source Code Package` 
and `Docker Compose` configuration files, you can access the repositories and download them directly from the browser.

import downloadAsZipImg from "@site/static//img/modules/get-started/access/download-as-zip.png";

<div  class="centerize">
	<div style={{ marginBottom: "2rem", maxWidth: "700px" }}>
    	<Image img={downloadAsZipImg} />
	</div>
</div>

For `Container Images` and `Node Packages`, you will need to configure your `Docker` and `npm` as follows to access.


## Configuring `Docker` to have access to pull Container Images

1. To check if you have access to the container registry, you can login to your `GitHub account` and then browse for the required images here: https://github.com/orgs/mssfoobar/packages.
If you are unable to see the container image you need, your account may not have the required access. Please approach AGIL Ops Hub team for assistant.

2. Next, you will need to generate a personal access token with `read:packages` scope to download container images. You can refer to GitHub's
official instructions on how to generate personal access tokens here: 
[Creating a GitHub Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic)

3. Login to Docker with the token:

<CodeBlock language="bash">
	{`$ echo `}
	<span className="highlight">TOKEN</span>
	{` | docker login ghcr.io -u `}
	<span className="highlight">USERNAME</span>
	{` --password-stdin`}
</CodeBlock>

-   Replace <span className="highlight">TOKEN</span> with your token generated in step 2
-   Replace <span className="highlight">USERNAME</span> with your GitHub username

For more details on working with GitHub's container registry, you can refer to their
[official documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry).


## Configuring `npm` to have access to pull packages

The simplest way to pull released node packages is to use the `Web Base` and `Web CLI Tools` to pull the packages required.
By default, `Web Base` will include an `.npmrc` file which points to `npm.pkg.github.com` for npm packages with
the `@mssfoobar` scope. 

Run the following command to configure `npm` to have access to pull the packages.

```bash
npm set //npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=<YOUR_GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN>
```
