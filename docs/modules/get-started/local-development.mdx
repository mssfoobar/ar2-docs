# Overview

AGIL Ops Hub maintains a set of `docker-compose` files in the
[dev-containers repository](https://github.com/mssfoobar/dev-containers). If you wish to run any module locally, the
easiest way to get all their dependencies up and running is by using this
repository.

The following document explains how you can use the `dev-containers` repository to quickly get a local development
environment up and running.

:::note
We use [Podman Desktop](https://podman-desktop.io/) because it works across Windows, macOS, and Linux, and its free - so
the rest of the instructions here will be with `podman`. You can replace `docker...` with `podman...` if you're using
Docker.
:::

## Guide

### 1. Clone the repository

#### 1.1 - Clone the git repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mssfoobar/dev-containers
```

#### 1.2 - Navigate into the root folder

```bash
cd dev-containers
```

### 2. Set up the environment variables

By default, the environment variable file already contains all the default values you need to get up and running
except for the `DEV_PASSWORD` & `DEV_PASSWORD_URL_ENCODED`.

```bash title=".env.template"
# Root domain to use for all services
DEV_DOMAIN=127.0.0.1.nip.io

# Global username and password used for everything
DEV_USER=admin
#highlight-start
DEV_PASSWORD=
#highlight-end

# Global username and password used for everything - but URL encoded - this is needed for connection strings
# as some passwords might have special symbols in them, such as "@", causing database connection strings to fail
# For example, if your DEV_PASSWORD is "strong_p@ssword", in DEV_PASSWORD_URL_ENCODED, it must be "strong_p%40ssword"
DEV_USER_URL_ENCODED=admin
#highlight-start
DEV_PASSWORD_URL_ENCODED=
#highlight-end
```

#### 2.1 - Make a copy of the file and rename it to `.env`

```bash
cp .env.template .env
```

#### 2.2 - Choose a suitable password and set it for both variables.

```bash title=".env"
# Root domain to use for all services
DEV_DOMAIN=127.0.0.1.nip.io

# Global username and password used for everything
DEV_USER=admin
#highlight-start
DEV_PASSWORD=myfavpassword
#highlight-end

# Global username and password used for everything - but URL encoded - this is needed for connection strings
# as some passwords might have special symbols in them, such as "@", causing database connection strings to fail
# For example, if your DEV_PASSWORD is "strong_p@ssword", in DEV_PASSWORD_URL_ENCODED, it must be "strong_p%40ssword"
DEV_USER_URL_ENCODED=admin
#highlight-start
DEV_PASSWORD_URL_ENCODED=myfavpassword
#highlight-end
```

### 3. Run the command for the module you want

Every `compose.yml` file in each folder is designed to already include the services they need, simply start it up with
the `.env` file and apply any overrides you need:

#### 3.1 - Example, for the `IAN` module, you can run it like so.

```bash
podman compose --env-file .env -f ian/compose.yml -f ./override.yml up -d
```

`override.yml` is meant for you to fill in overrides for port mapping (for scenarios such as directly accessing
the databases with your database management client).

:::warning
For Docker users, you must use the override to override the default `traefik` settings as it is assuming you
are using `Podman` - the `volumes:` entry is different to bind to the appropriate `docker.sock`.
:::

In the future, we intend to provide tooling with this information integrated. For now, each module states
all their dependencies in their respective folders, so if you want to include the `GIS`
(Geospatial Information Services) module, look at the `README.md` in it's folder and run that command.

## Additional Configuration

#### Wildcard DNS vs Host file

Custom hostname resolution is required for proper development - the system relies on cookies being forwarded to the
front-facing servers for authentication.

You can use a wildcard DNS service like `https://nip.io` or modify your `/etc/hosts` file.

### Wildcard DNS (nip.io)

If you're using `nip.io`, set the `DEV_DOMAIN` environment variable to get `nip.io` to resolve it to the loopback address:

```
DEV_DOMAIN=127.0.0.1.nip.io
```

For your web services, make sure the `PUBLIC_DOMAIN` is set appropriately (to nip.io)

```
PUBLIC_DOMAIN=nip.io
```

This requires no additional changes to your system - you may then access services via their appropriate subdomain,
for example, to visit the Keycloak admin site, you will go to http://iams-keycloak.127.0.0.1.nip.io

### Host file

Alternatively, you can modify your `hosts` file to allow your machine to resolve the addresses appropriately, you can do
this by adding the values below to your hosts file in `C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts` in Windows, or
`/etc/hosts` in Unix systems.

```title="/etc/hosts"
## -------------------- AOH Local Development --------------------
## ========== Traefik ==========
127.0.0.1 traefik.localhost

## ========== IAMS ==========
127.0.0.1 iams-keycloak.localhost iams-aas.localhost iams-web.localhost iams-db.localhost

## ========== Web Base ==========
127.0.0.1 web-base.localhost

## ========== RTUS ==========
127.0.0.1 rtus-seh.localhost rtus-pms.localhost rtus-db.localhost

## ========== TAG ==========
127.0.0.1 tag.localhost tag-web.localhost tag-db.localhost

## ========== UNH ==========
127.0.0.1 unh.localhost unh-web.localhost unh-db.localhost

## ========== IAN ==========
127.0.0.1 ian.localhost ian-web.localhost ian-db.localhost

## ========== DASH ==========
127.0.0.1 dash.localhost dash-web.localhost dash-db.localhost

## ========== GIS ==========
127.0.0.1 gis.localhost gis-web.localhost gis-db.localhost

## ========== WFE ==========
127.0.0.1 wfe.localhost wfe-web.localhost wfe-db.localhost
```

For your web services, make sure the `PUBLIC_DOMAIN` is left blank, this is a mandatory cookie setting for
browsers when the domain is meant to be `localhost`, you can use the `compose.override.yml` to achieve this.

```title="compose.override.yml"
name: aoh

services:
    iams-web:
        environment:
            - PUBLIC_DOMAIN=

    ...
```

## Troubleshooting

### Updating Container Images

By default, the `dev-containers` repository uses `latest-dev` for all our tags. Docker/Podman will not automatically
pull the newest image as we're re-using the 'latest-dev' tag. You'll have to either delete the image locally or
manually pull the latest[-dev] tagged image to receive the newest updated images.

### Changing Env Vars

The env vars are used as part of the initialization process - it includes generating users, setting credentials, etc.
and all these are persisted in the `.data` folder as it is used in the Docker volumes. If you need to change any of the
environment variables (`DEV_DOMAIN`, `DEV_USER` or `DEV_PASSWORD`), do not expect the values to be reflected without
re-initializing everything (you will need to delete `.data` and restart everything).

### Unable to login to Keycloak

Since Keycloak 26, the `KEYCLOAK_ADMIN` and `KEYCLOAK_PASSWORD` have been deprecated and replaced with
`KC_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_USERNAME` and `KC_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD`. If you are having difficulties logging in, you might be
using an older container.

### Podman

#### Credential issues when migrating from Docker

There is a common issue you might face when Docker was installed and you are switching over to `podman`. If you are
able to pull the containers manually, but not when you run `podman compose ...` please visit the following link to see
how you can resolve it: https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/22682

#### Traefik

For Traefik to perform routing, it needs access to the Docker API via the `docker.sock`, for Podman, that is available
at `/run/podman/podman.sock` by default. If you're having problems with Traefik look for the `remoteSocket` config:

```
podman info
```

```title: Sample Output
remoteSocket:
    exists: true
    path: /run/podman/podman.sock
```

Under "path": You might see something other than `/run/podman/podman.sock`, in that scenario, use the `override.yml`
file to modify it appropriately:

```
cp override.sample.yml override.yml
```

```
## Use this override file to override any default configuration
## Example Use Case: Forward ports to a database you want to access
name: aoh

services:
    traefik:
        volumes:
            - /run/user/example/podman.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
```

Then, run the command with the module you want and try again:

```
podman compose --env-file .env -f example_module/compose.yml -f override.yml
```
