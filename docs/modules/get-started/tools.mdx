# Tools

This section provides information on some of the recommended tools to use for development.

## Git

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a distributed version control system that is widely used in the industry for tracking changes in source code 
during software development. 

In AGIL Ops Hub, we are using Git and [GitHub Repositories](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories) as the central repository for our own 
source control. 
It is recommended that the project should use Git for version control and central repository server such as GitHub or Gitlab, to facilitate 
source collaboration among project members.  

Follow the guide on [GitHub's Git Guides](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git) for thorough instructions on how to install Git on
Windows, MacOS and Linux.


## Docker Engine / Podman

AGIL Ops Hub based application is designed to operate in a `containerized environment`. 
For development, developer will need development tools, such as `Docker Engine`, for creating, sharing and running individual containers.

For developers using `Linux` or `Mac`, the steps are pretty straightforward, and can be found in https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/.

:::note
For developers using `Mac` on `ARM` architecture, the container image created will be `ARM` based and will not able to run in `x86-64` architecture.

To build `x86-64` container image, will need to use `Docker Buildx` which is included in Docker Engine v20.x or later. Refer to  
[Building x86 Images on an Apple M1 Chip](https://everythingdevops.dev/building-x86-images-on-an-apple-m1-chip/) for more information.
:::


For developers using `Windows` machine, to be able to build `Linux` container, require setting up `WSL2` or `Linux VM` in the `Windows` machine.

A simpler approach would be to use `Podman Desktop` instead, a good open source alternative to `Docker Desktop` which required a fee for non-personal use. 

Refer to Installing Podman Desktop and Podman on Windows https://podman-desktop.io/docs/installation/windows-install for the instruction.

:::note
To run podman compose, you must perform additional set up, refer to the following link for details: https://podman-desktop.io/docs/compose/setting-up-compose

## Visual Studio Code

For integrated development environment (IDE), we recommend using [Visual Studio Code (aka VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/) 
with the following extensions:

### Frontend

#### JavaScript & Web:

VSCode comes with TypeScript support out-of-the-box.

-   Svelte: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=svelte.svelte-vscode
-   ESLint: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint
-   Prettier: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode
-   Tailwind CSS: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss

### Backend

####  Golang
-   https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=golang.go

#### Spring Boot

- Extension Pack for Java: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-pack
- Spring Boot Extension Pack: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vmware.vscode-boot-dev-pack


### Code Quality

-  SonarQube for IDE: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SonarSource.sonarlint-vscode
-  Snyk Security: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=snyk-security.snyk-vulnerability-scanner


## Node.js 

For frontend development, you will need to install [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 20 or above.

For `Windows` environment, the easiest way to install is to use the `Windows Installer`.

As for `Linux` and `Mac` environment, you can use the Package Manager to install.
Refer to [Installing Node.js via Package Managers](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/all#installing-nodejs-via-package-managers) for more information.


## Golang

If you are using golang for backend development or developing custom Workflow Activities, you will need to install golang using instruction 
found in [Download and install](https://go.dev/doc/install). 

## Java 

If you are using Spring Boot for backend development, you will need to install Java JDK. We recommend using OpenJDK instead of Oracle Java SDK.
Azul Systems provided OpenJDK build for many OS and platform, refer to https://docs.azul.com/core/install/docker for instruction to 
install in your required platform.
