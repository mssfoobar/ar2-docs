# Tools

This section provides information on some of the recommended tools to use for development.

## Git

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a distributed version control system that is widely used in the industry for tracking changes in source code
during software development.

In AGIL Ops Hub, we are using Git and [GitHub Repositories](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories) as the central repository for our own
source control.
It is recommended that the project should use Git for version control and central repository server such as GitHub or Gitlab, to facilitate
source collaboration among project members.

Follow the guide on [GitHub's Git Guides](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git) for thorough instructions on how to install Git on
Windows, MacOS and Linux.

## Docker Engine / Podman

AGIL Ops Hub is designed to operate in a `containerized environment`. For development, developers will need development
tools, such as `Docker Engine`, for creating, sharing and running individual containers.

For developers using `Linux` or `Mac`, the installation steps are pretty straightforward, and can be found in
[here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

:::note
For computers on the `ARM` architecture (such as with `Apple Silicon`), the container image created will be `ARM` based and will not able to run in `x86-64` architecture.

To build `x86-64` container images, you will need to use `Docker Buildx` which is included in Docker Engine v20.x or
later. Refer to
[Building x86 Images on an Apple M1 Chip](https://everythingdevops.dev/building-x86-images-on-an-apple-m1-chip/) for
more information.
:::

For developers using `Windows` machines that wish to build `Linux` containers, they will need to set up `WSL2` or
a `Linux VM`. A simpler approach would be to use `Podman Desktop` instead, a good open-source alternative to
`Docker Desktop` which is **NOT FREE** for non-personal use.

Refer to [Installing Podman Desktop and Podman on Windows](https://podman-desktop.io/docs/installation/windows-install)
for installation instructions.

:::note
To run `podman compose`, you must perform additional set up steps, refer to the following link for
more details: https://podman-desktop.io/docs/compose/setting-up-compose

## Visual Studio Code

For your integrated development environment (IDE), we recommend using
[Visual Studio Code (aka VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the following extensions:

### Frontend

#### JavaScript & Web:

VSCode comes with TypeScript support out-of-the-box.

-   Svelte: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=svelte.svelte-vscode
-   ESLint: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint
-   Prettier: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode
-   Tailwind CSS: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss

### Backend

#### Golang

-   Golang: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=golang.go

#### Spring Boot

-   Extension Pack for Java: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-pack
-   Spring Boot Extension Pack: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vmware.vscode-boot-dev-pack

### Code Quality

-   SonarQube for IDE: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SonarSource.sonarlint-vscode
-   Snyk Security: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=snyk-security.snyk-vulnerability-scanner

### Misc

-   Docker: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-docker

## Node.js

For frontend development, you will need to install [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 20 or above.

For `Windows` machines, the easiest way to install is to use the official Windows installer which you can get from the
[official website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

As for `Linux` and `Mac`, you can use their respective package managers to perform the installation.
Refer to [Installing Node.js via Package Managers](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/all#installing-nodejs-via-package-managers) for more information.

## Golang

If you are using golang for backend development or developing custom `Workflow Activities`, you will need to install
golang using instructions found in [download and install](https://go.dev/doc/install).

## Java

If you are using Spring Boot for backend development, you will need to install the Java JDK. We recommend using OpenJD
instead of Oracle Java SDK. Azul Systems provides an OpenJDK build for many OS's and platforms; refer to
https://docs.azul.com/core/install/docker for instructions on how to install the OpenJDK on your required platform.
