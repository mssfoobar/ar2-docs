# Tools

This section provides information on some of the recommended tools to use for development.

## Git

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a distributed version control system that is widely used in the industry for tracking changes in source code 
during software development. 

In AGIL Ops Hub, we are using Git and [GitHub Repositories](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories) as the central repository for our own 
source control. 
It is recommended that the project should use Git for version control and central repository server such as GitHub or Gitlab, to facilitate 
source collaboration among project members.  

Follow the guide on [GitHub's Git Guides](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git) for thorough instructions on how to install Git on
Windows, MacOS and Linux.


## Docker Engine / Podman

AGIL Ops Hub based application is designed to operate in a `containerized environment`. 
For development, developer will need development tools, such as `Docker Engine`, for creating, sharing and running individual containers.

For developers using `Linux` or `Mac`, the steps are pretty straightforward, and can be found in https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/.

:::note
For developers using `Mac` on `ARM` architecture, the container image created will be `ARM` based and will not able to run in `x86-64` architecture.

To build `x86-64` container image, will need to use `Docker Buildx` which is included in Docker Engine v20.x or later. Refer to  
[Building x86 Images on an Apple M1 Chip](https://everythingdevops.dev/building-x86-images-on-an-apple-m1-chip/) for more information.
:::


For developers using `Windows` machine, to be able to build `Linux` container, require setting up `WSL2` or `Linux VM` in the `Windows` machine.

A simpler approach would be to use `Podman Desktop` instead, a good open source alternative to `Docker Desktop` which required a fee for non-personal use. 

Refer to Installing Podman Desktop and Podman on Windows https://podman-desktop.io/docs/installation/windows-install for the instruction.

:::note
To run podman compose, you must perform additional set up, refer to the following link for details: https://podman-desktop.io/docs/compose/setting-up-compose
