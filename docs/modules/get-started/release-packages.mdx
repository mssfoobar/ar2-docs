# Release Packages

AGIL Ops Hub release consists of the followings:
-	`Container Images` and corresponding `Docker Compose` configuration files
-	`Node packages`
-	Source Code Packages

Those release artifacts will be make available via private `GitHub Package Registry` and `Source Repository`. 
Please approach one of the AGIL Ops Hub team members to request for access.

Although possible, it is `not` recommended to have all your project team members to directly access AGIL Ops Hub Private Package Registry 
and Source Repository for those artifacts for both development and production.

Instead, your project should designate a member, i.e., `Configuration Manager`, to review and move only the required artifacts into your 
project own Artefact Registry and Source Repository. 
Rest of the project members should only access project own Artefact Registry and Source Repositories for the required artifacts.

This will allow better dependency management within your project. 
Furthermore, `Docker Compose` configuration files and Web App project will need to be updated based on project’s needs. 
The updated files should be stored in project’s Source Repository for version control.      



## Container Images

All AGIL Ops Hub modules, except `Web Base`, will have container images for the `backend` services and some may also have container images 
for the `frontend` Web App.

The container image for `backend` services are intended to be use `as is`, for both `development` and `production`. 

As for the `frontend` Web app containers, they contain the pre-built Web Base bundled with the respective Web Component from the Module. It 
is intended for project to experiment with the features of the module and `not` intended for production use. 

In a typical project deployment, you will most probable combine a few Modules’ Web component into single one Web Base, 
modified the Web UIs to follow the project’s specific UI/UX design, and then build them into your own container image for production use.    

As mentioned, project should review and only move the container images of those modules that are required, to own `Container Registry`. 

In general, the steps to transfer the container images into project `Container Registry` involve:
-	Pulling the container images using `Docker` or `Podman`
-	Re-tag the images
-	And push the images into project `Container Registry`.     

For project with `air-gap` requirement, the steps will be as follows:
-	Pull the container images using `Docker` or `Podman` in an Internet connected machine
-	Export the container images into tar archives using the `save` command in `Docker` or `Podman`
-	Move the tar archives into the `air-gapped` environment
-	`Load` the container images back into `Docker` or `Podman` from the tar achieve files   
-	Re-tag the images
-	And push the images into project `Container Registry`

## Docker Compose Files

AGIL Ops Hub also released a set of corresponding `Docker Compose` configuration files to run those containers in `Docker` or `Podman` engine.
This allow developer to quickly setup of local development environment to kick-start development. 

:::danger
The `Docker Compose` configuration files are intended to be used to deploy containers in `Docker` or `Podman` engine for `development` purpose only. 

It is `not` recommended to deploy containers in `Docker` or `Podman` engine for `production`, except for small scale project that only have a handful 
of containers and with no high-available (HA) requirement.

For most projects, it is recommended to use `Kubernetes` or equivalent container orchestration platform (e.g., `Docker Swarm` or `Amazon Elastic Container Service`).

As production deployment environment varies across projects, it is not possible to provide a standard set of deployment manifest files. AGIL Ops Hub team will 
instead work with the project to craft the manifest files for the specific target environment. 
:::

The `Docker Compose` configuration files are published in the [dev-containers repository](https://github.com/mssfoobar/dev-containers). 

The steps to move those files to project own Source Repository are as follows:
-	Download the `dev-containers` repository as zip
-	Unzip to local machine
-   Review and modified the files based on project and environment needs
-	Add the modified files to the project Source Repository for version control and share among project members


## Node Packages

AGIL Ops Hub released `node packages` for the followings:
-	Module Web Components
-	Web CLI tool
-	Web Libraries

`Module Web Components` are node packages that can be installed into `Web Base` using `Web CLI tool`. 
This allow the project to only add (install) module's Web Components that are needed by the project.

The `Web CLI tool` that is used to install `Module Web Components` is itself a `node package` which will be installed when the `Web Base` is initialized.

Another group of `node packages` are `Web Libraries`, reusable libraries to simplify web development. Currently, it contains:
-	`Logger` – logging library for both Web frontend (at browser console) and Web backend (at container) logging.
-	`SSE Client` – to simplify writing server-send events (SSE) code on the frontend.
-	`GraphQL Client` – facilitate access GraphQL APIs from frontend.
 
Generally, the steps to move the `node packages` to project’s `Artefact Registry` is as follows:
-	Installs the package at the specified version using the `npm install` command.
-	Sets the registry to the project’s registry using the `npm config set` command.
-	Publishes the package to project registry using the `npm publish` command.


##	Source Code Packages

AGIL Ops Hub published Source Code Packages for the followings:
-	Web Base
-	Workflow Activity Template
-	Workflow Studio

`Web Base` is a scaffold `SvelteKit` project that provides a skeleton application to kick-start web development using AGIL Ops Hub. 
For more information, refer to [Web Base Section](../web-base/overview.md)

Workflow Activity Template is a scaffold `golang` project that provides template project code to kick-start workflow activity development using golang. 
For more information, refer to [Workflow Activity Development Section](../wfe/development/development.mdx)

Workflow Studio is the Web App that allows user to configure workflow. Project can directly use the pre-built Workflow Studio container for deployment.
But if project require to customize the Workflow Studio for whatever reason, the source code is also provided for project to do so.

Those Source Code Packages can be access from the respective Source Repository and the steps to move them to project own Source Repository is as follows:
-	Download the repository as zip
-	Unzip and add them to the project Source Repository.
