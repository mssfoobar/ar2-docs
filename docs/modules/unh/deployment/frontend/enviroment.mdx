# Environments

The UNH frontend module uses the [web-base](/docs/modules/web-base/overview/overview.md) module, meaning most of the environment variables are inherited from there. However, there are a few specific environment variables that are unique to the UNH module, listed below:

### 1. IAMS_AAS_URL

This is the internal URL for the `iams-aas` service from the [IAMS](/docs/modules/iams/overview/features.md) module, which is responsible for handling tenant data.

### 2. LOGIN_DESTINATION

This is the path to which users will be redirected after login. For the UNH module, the route should be set to: `/aoh/unh/distributions`

### 3. UNH_URL

This is the internal URL for the UNH backend service.

### 4. PUBLIC_IAN_URL (Optional)

This is the internal URL for the IAN module's backend service. You only need to set this variable if you wish to use the IAN module that is already integrated into the UNH module.

### 5. PUBLIC_RTUS_SEH_URL (Optional)

This is the internal URL for the RTUS SEH module's backend service. You only need to set this variable if you wish to use the IAN module that is already integrated into the UNH module.
