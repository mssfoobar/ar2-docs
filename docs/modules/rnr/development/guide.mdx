# Develop guide

Record and Replay (rnr) is an auxiliary service for recording and playing back events over a period of time in the past.
It is able to capture data change in the main database - `live database` and update all changes into `playback database`.
We're using another database to pre-processing all CDC events which were published from debezium and store them in `processing database`.
Besides that RTUS service is used for real-time update data in client.

**Prerequisite**
- [Go](https://go.dev/) 
- [NATS](https://nats.io/)

### Setup Debezium and NATS connector
- Setup debezium by following [Debezium deployment](/docs/modules/rnr/deployment/debezium.mdx)
- Setup NATS locally [NATS](/docs/modules/rnr/development/nats.mdx)

### 1. Setup TransformMsg module
- TransformMsg is a backend module to consume, transform events from debezium to SQL statement then store in database. Example event: [event](https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/stable/tutorial.html#:~:text=Review%20the%20details%20of%20the%20same%20event%E2%80%99s%20value.)
- When initializing or starting playback session, MsgOp will query and execute all SQL satement which were been performed during that time.

- Using Golang
- Database: PostgreSQL, using [lib-pg](https://github.com/lib/pq)
- Handler: NATS jetstream, using [nats-jetstream](https://github.com/nats-io/nats.go/jetstream)

- Running TransformMsg:
    - By k8s: following TransformMsg part in [RnR Deployment](/docs/modules/rnr/deployment/record-and-replay.mdx)
    - By go:
        - Copy `.transform-msg.env.sample` to `.transform-msg.env` and fullfil all variables, reference TransformMsg in [RnR Configuration](/docs/modules/rnr/configuration/record-and-replay.mdx)
        - Run command to start application
        ```bash
            go run cmd/transform-msg/main.go
        ```
        :::info
        Run command to download all modules/packages. 
        ```bash
            go mod tidy
        ```

### 2. Setup ReplayManager (ReplayMgr) module
- ReplayMgr is a backend module that expose RESTful API for clients, also communication with others services (DbOP and MsgOp) by NATS. 
It handles request from client, check the correctness of request, then publish events to other services to proceed the playback session.
- Using Golang
- Database: PostgreSQL, using [lib-pg](https://github.com/lib/pq)
- Handler:
    - RESTful API, using `https://github.com/go-chi/chi`
    - NATS jetstream, using [nats-jetstream](https://github.com/nats-io/nats.go/jetstream)
- Integrate RTUS to update real-time session status to client.
- Running ReplayMgr:
    - By k8s: following ReplayMgr part in [RnR Deployment](/docs/modules/rnr/deployment/record-and-replay.mdx)
    - By go:
        - Copy `.replay-manager.env.sample` to `.replay-manager.env` and fullfil all variables, reference ReplayMgr in [RnR Configuration](/docs/modules/rnr/configuration/record-and-replay.mdx)
        - Run command to start application
        ```bash
            go run cmd/replay-manager/main.go
        ```
        :::info
        Run command to download all modules/packages. 
        ```bash
            go mod tidy
        ```

### 3. Setup Database Operator (DBOP) module
- DBOP is a backend module that perform database initialize. It is in charge for finding backup (dump) file from `looking database` which store backup information
then pull down a backup file and restore in `playback database`.
- Currently, we're using [minio][https://min.io/] to store backup file.
- DBOP is triggered by NATS event in EventStream and EventSubject.
- Using Golang and bash script.
- Handler: NATS jetstream, using [nats-jetstream](https://github.com/nats-io/nats.go/jetstream)
- Running DBOP:
    - By k8s: following DBOP part in [RnR Deployment](/docs/modules/rnr/deployment/record-and-replay.mdx)
    - By go:
        - Copy `.db-operator.env.sample` to `.db-operator.env` and fullfil all variables, reference DBOP in [RnR Configuration](/docs/modules/rnr/configuration/record-and-replay.mdx)
        - Run command to start application
        ```bash
            go run cmd/db-operator/main.go
        ```
        :::info
        Run command to download all modules/packages. 
        ```bash
            go mod tidy
        ```

### 4. Message Operator (MsgOp) module
- MsgOp is a backend module that perform initialize, and playback session.
- MsgOp is triggered by NATS event in EventStream and EventSubject.
- During these operations such as init, play, pause, etc MsgOp queries all SQL statement in session time from `processing database` then executes them in `playback database`.

- Using Golang.
- Database: PostgreSQL, using [lib-pg](https://github.com/lib/pq)
- Handler: NATS jetstream, using [nats-jetstream](https://github.com/nats-io/nats.go/jetstream)
- Running MsgOp:
    - By k8s: following MsgOp part in [RnR Deployment](/docs/modules/rnr/deployment/record-and-replay.mdx)
    - By go:
        - Copy `.msg-operator.env.sample` to `.msg-operator.env` and fullfil all variables, reference MsgOp in [RnR Configuration](/docs/modules/rnr/configuration/record-and-replay.mdx)
        - Run command to start application
        ```bash
            go run cmd/msg-operator/main.go
        ```
        :::info
        Run command to download all modules/packages. 
        ```bash
            go mod tidy
        ```
