# CLI (Command-line Interface)

We offer a command-line interface (CLI) to simplify and automate common tasks encountered during product development.
In build, is also a installer tool that allows the user to install our modules seemlessly into the web-base. 

The command-line interface is pre-installed as a dependency in the web-base.

## Quick Start
 To view the commands available, run,
 ```
   npx cli 
 ```

 ## Commands
 Currently the commands the CLI has are,
  ### 1. **install**
  - Installs the module and add its required files into the web-base repository. E.g. To install the incident module (IMS) for example, run this command
  
  ```
	npx cli install @mssfoobar/ims
  ```
