# CLI (Command-line Interface)

We offer a command-line interface (CLI) to simplify and automate common tasks encountered during product development.
In build, is also a installer tool that allows the user to install our modules seemlessly into the web-base.

## Commands
 Currently the commands the CLI has is 
  1. **install** \< module_name \>
  - Installers the module and add its required files into the web-base repository. E.g. To install the incident module (IMS) for example, run this command
  
  ```
	npx cli install @mssfoobar/ims
  ```
