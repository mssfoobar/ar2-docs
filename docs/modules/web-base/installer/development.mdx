This section outlines the `cli-installer`'s underlying implementation, enabling current owners to extend its functionality and enhance its capabilities.

# Command

The commands the cli-installer current possess is

- `install` - This command facilitates the installation of modules for the web-base by encapsulating the npm install. It copies out the module's required files
  and folders and installs their depenencies, making the integration almost seemless to the user.

Users can execute this command by running

```bash
npx cli install <module_name>
```
# Prompts

The installer module commands probably requires alot of user prompts. Therefore the library that we are using that supports that is the `commander` library.
`Commander` is a popular Node.js library that simplifies the creation of command-line interfaces (CLIs). It provides a declarative and intuitive API for defining commands,
options, and arguments, making it easier to build powerful and user-friendly CLIs. For more information on this library, you may view [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/commander)
