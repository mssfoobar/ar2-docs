# Quickstart

:### Setup web-base

To use this module, you'll need the web-base component. If you've already installed it, you can skip ahead.

### 1. Clone web-base repository

Use the github CLI to clone the web-base project.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mssfoobar/web-base
```

Please refer to the web-base documentation to setup the pre-requisites for the web-base to work. You may refer to it
[here](https://mssfoobar.github.io/docs/docs/modules/base/Getting_Started/pre-requisite).

### 2. Install dependencies

Install node dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

Once done, you have a functioning web-base to install the dashboard module.

## Installing the Incident Management Service Module

### Configuring Environment Variables

The ims module has backend service that we need to connect to. To successfully connect to the backend services, you'll need to configure a few environment variables beforehand. You may refer to <a href="backend/introduction.md">here</a>

:::note
Please ensure that the `ims` services are set up and ready prior to installing the ims module.
:::

-   IMS_URL = 'link to your ims backend service'
-   LOGIN_DESTINATION = 'aoh/ims' --- this is optional, if you want to default route to the ims main page when authenticated.



### Pre-installation
The IMS module requires a certain set of dev dependencies, therefore, we need to install them before installing the module
```bash
npm install -D zod
npm install -D sveltekit-superforms
npm install -D formsnap
```


### Installing the IMS Module via the CLI.
The web-base contains a module installer to install modules to the web-base. You may use this command to install the incident module. Running this command will download and copy over the required files over to your web-base repository, together with the dependencies installed into the package.json

```bash
npx cli install @mssfoobar/ims
```


### Running
You may now run in dev mode and commence your development, the ims home-page can be visited at /aoh/ims

``` bash
npm run dev
```
