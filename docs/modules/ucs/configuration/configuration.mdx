# Configuration

All the configuration for the services are inside the `.toml` files.

To run locally set the configuration inside `VidConf/VidConf-ion/configs` or
if you want to deploy using docker set the configuration inside `VidConf/VidConf-ion/configs/docker`.

## SFU Configuration

If browser cannot establish the ice candidate pair with SFU, consider mapping external ip address to `sfu.toml` file.

```
# if the sfu is deployed in a DMZ between two 1-1 NAT for internal and
# external users.
nat1to1 = ["xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx"]
icelite = true
```

Or use stun/turn server

```
[[webrtc.iceserver]]
urls = ["stun:example:3478"]

[[webrtc.iceserver]]
urls = ["turn:turn.example.org:3478"]
username = "username"
credential = "password"
```

Or enable embeded sfu turn server

```
[turn]
# Enables embeded turn server
enabled = true
# Sets the realm for turn server
realm = "ion"
# The address the TURN server will listen on.
address = "0.0.0.0:3478"
# Certs path to config tls/dtls
# cert="path/to/cert.pem"
# key="path/to/key.pem"
# Port range that turn relays to SFU
# WARNING: It shouldn't overlap webrtc.portrange
# Format: [min, max]
# portrange = [5201, 5400]
[turn.auth]
# Use an auth secret to generate long-term credentials defined in RFC5389-10.2
# NOTE: This takes precedence over `credentials` if defined.
# secret = "secret"
# Sets the credentials pairs
credentials = "pion=ion,pion2=ion2"
```

:::info
credentials pair are separated by '='. pion=ion means username = pion and crendential = ion
:::

## Browser Configuration

If SFU is configured to be used with stun/turn server, please specific the stun/turn in browser configuration.

```tsx
const config = {
	iceServers: [
		{
			urls: ["turn:turn.example.org:3478"],
			username: "username",
			credential: "password",
		},
	],
};
```
