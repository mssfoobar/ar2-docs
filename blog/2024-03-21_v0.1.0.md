Happy release day!

## Module Features

#### Dashboarding:

-   Dashboard Selector & List:
    -   A new dashboard selector, with labels, filtering and favoriting has been added.
    -   A dashboard list with a dashboard preview is now available from selecting `Browse All` in the new dashboard selector.
    -   Users' last selected dashboard will now be saved and restored when revisiting the page.
-   The widget preview has been updated to much more accurately reflect how a widget might look in a dashboard.
-   A new full screen mode button has been added that can be activated in view mode (press ESC to exit); this mode hides the side panels and makes the dashboard fill up the entire screen. This is useful for video wall scenarios.

#### Incident Management:

-   Incident page has a new search bar to facilitate better navigation and experience.

#### Record & Replay:

-   Added quick-start & configuration guide in [AGIL Ops Hub Docs](https://mssfoobar.github.io/docs/docs/category/-guides-2/).

#### Workflow Management:

-   Workflows now support manual switch recovery when none of the switch conditions are met.
-   The workflow management engine now support looping back of processes in workflows.
-   The workflow designer is now integrated as part of the web application (instead of a separate stand-alone service).

## Framework Features

#### Web Application Framework:

-   A new UI State store is now available for developers to restore users' UI states \[[Docs Link](https://mssfoobar.github.io/docs/docs/web/api/ui_state)\].
-   Streaming subscription variable updates on retires can now be controlled via operation context \[[Docs Link](http://localhost:3030/docs/docs/web/guides/development#broken-queries-subscriptions-and-retries)\].

#### Service Application Framework:

-   Changes from Hasura GraphQL to pure SQL queries using [sqlc](https://github.com/sqlc-dev/sqlc).
-   Services (starting with `Incident Management` & `Record & Replay`) now support schema migration on service startup using `go-migrate`.
-   Updated _Readme_ with details on how to use `sqlc` & `go-migrate`.

## Fixes

-   Dashboard widget configuration no longer applies to multiple dashboard widgets of the same type when editing one dashboard.
-   GraphQL subscriptions now retry quickly and exponentially backoff correctly, as well as no longer throw errors to `urql`, causing re-subscriptions to occur at the `graphql-ws` level instead of the `urql` level.

    This means subscriptions no longer cause unnecessary errors when JWT tokens expire and the WebSocket closes, and retries are stable.

-   Fixed record & replay sometimes having random time skips.
-   Fixed record & replay UI sometimes not loading correctly.
-   Fixed chat messages sometimes being duplicated or coming in out-of-order.
-   Fixed incident notifications sometimes being duplicated or coming in out-of-order.
-   Fixed map crashing when being accessed directly via URL (but worked when accessed via side menu)
-   Domain used for cookies must now be set explicitly (via the `PUBLIC_DOMAIN` environment variable) instead of implicitly using the top level domain. This allows different versions of the app to be deployed on the same domain (by using separating cookies by sub-domains).

## Field Day

Field Day is an application build on AGIL Ops Hub that introduces the management of `trips`. A trip is composed of the many `participants` that might partake in the trip, as well as an `itinerary`, which is a collection of `activities`.

-   Web Application

    Users have the ability to view and manage trips, this involves:

    -   Adding or removing participant
    -   Adding or removing activities from the itinerary
    -   Assigning/re-assigning in-charges for the trips.

    The application also provides a map to show all on-going trips, as well as any associated incidents that might cause need for attention (e.g. a sudden earthquake might negatively impact a nearby trip).

-   Mobile

    A flutter mobile application is also available for `Field Day`, allowing personnel who are in charge of a trip to manage incidents that take place within their trip by:

    -   Viewing existing incidents that are happening during the trip
    -   Creating incidents associated with the trip
    -   Tagging incidents with a geolocation.
