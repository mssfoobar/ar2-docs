We intend to provide more consistent release notes with a release versioning scheme that will be useful for projects utilizing AGIL Ops Hub.\\n\\nPragmatic versioning comes with 3 numbers, separated by periods, just like semantic versioning. However, the numbers correspond to `BIG RELEASE` . `ANNOUNCEMENT` . `INCREMENT`. Read more about [Pragmatic Versioning](https://github.com/seveibar/pragmaticversioning).\\n\\n## Individual Services - Semantic Versioning\\n\\nAs for individual services and/or packages and libraries, we\'ll be sticking to the typical [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).\\n\\n## Why the discrepancy?\\n\\nIt makes more sense to use pragmatic versioning for the overall system as it is actually an aggregation of many different\\nservices, as well as the architecture of the entire system. The versioning of the overall system also carries branding,\\nand other meanings. If we use semantic versioning for that, it can be quite unclear which number to increase for the\\noverall system, or simply not useful. Pragmatic versioning more closely matches the message we want to convey.\\n\\nAs for indivdual services or packages, it\'s much clearer whether a change is a `MAJOR`, `MINOR`, or `PATCH` and that\\nmessage can be conveyed through the version numbers."}]}}')}}]);
